#     # TD Buy Setup, The buy setup bar 1 starts to count when the close of the current bar is lower than the close four bars earlier,
#     # the 2 counts if the bar next to the 1 closes lower than the close four bars earlier, and so on... The count needs to be back to back.
#     # The Minimal Buy Setup (min_buy_setup): If we reach bar8 8, to be classified as a minimal buy setup, the low of bar 8 has to be equal
#     # or lower to the low of bars 6 and 7. Otherwise it will be just a normal 8.
#     # THe Perfect Buy Setup (perfect_buy_setup): If we reach bar 9, the td buy setup is perfected if either bar 9 and 8's low is equal or
#     # lower than the lows of bars 6 and 7self
#     ## OBS: The TD Sell Setup works exactly with the oposite assumptions from the bear market to the bull market.
#     ### Here with a couple of conditional statements all the conditions regarding the bear and bull market, to make a new column(named: td),
#     ### wich is the td of the candle.
